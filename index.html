    <p id="bio"> WYATT WINBORNE knew that he wanted to make movies at a very young age. During high school, he briefly turned to making music, selling and writing songs for a number of films, including Chris Columbus’ PIXELS (2015), THE BYE BYE MAN (2017), and ALL I SEE IS YOU (2017). However, he quickly began to realize that nothing captivated his attention more than film, and returned to his passion for filmmaking. Since then, he has directed music videos for MUNA, I Know Leopard, and Phatrabbit, as well as having edited a number of short films and music videos. He spends every waking hour either watching, writing, or reading about films, and wouldn’t dream of life any other way. <br> <br> </p>
